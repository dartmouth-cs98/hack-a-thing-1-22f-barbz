# Hack Technology / Project Attempted


## What you built? 

We attempted to build an AR app using Unity3d. We followed 3 different tutorials for this. One to set us up. One to give us a general tutorial and the last one to build an IKEA AR like app. We also worked on creating an expo app using react-native. 

Include some screenshots.
